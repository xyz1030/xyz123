Got it! For a simple demonstration, you can read from an Excel file in Power BI instead of a database. Here's a step-by-step guide with a sample Excel dataset and how to implement it in Power BI.

✅ Sample Excel Data (You can create this in Excel)
Create a file named SalesData.xlsx and in Sheet1, add the following:


Date	Product	Category	Units Sold	Unit Price	Total Sales
2024-01-01	T-Shirt	Clothing	10	300	3000
2024-01-02	Jeans	Clothing	5	1000	5000
2024-01-03	Shoes	Footwear	8	1500	12000
2024-01-04	Cap	Accessories	12	200	2400
2024-01-05	Jacket	Clothing	3	2500	7500
Save it as:
📂 SalesData.xlsx
