Sure! Let’s go step by step in a **flow-wise explanation** of how your **manual decision tree** code works. I’ll explain the logic clearly and in simple terms — even if you're new to Python.

---

## 🔁 High-Level Flow (How This Code Runs):

1. **Read Titanic data** from a CSV file.
2. **Build a decision tree** based on this data (using Gini impurity).
3. **Print the decision tree** in a readable format.
4. **Predict survival for the first passenger in the data** using the decision tree.

---

## 🧠 Background Concepts

- **Decision Tree** is a model used to make decisions. It keeps splitting the data into branches based on conditions (like "Age < 15?" or "Sex = male?").
- **Gini impurity** measures how "mixed" the classes are (how pure or impure the branch is).

## 💡 Step-by-Step Code Breakdown

---

### 1. 📂 `load_csv(filename)`

**What it does:**  
Reads data from a CSV file line-by-line.

```python
inputs = [
    float(row[0]),      # Age
    row[1].strip(),     # Passenger Class
    row[2].strip(),     # Sex
    float(row[3]),      # Siblings/Spouses
    float(row[4]),      # Parents/Children
    float(row[5])       # Fare
]
label = row[6].strip()  # Survived: Yes/No
```

✅ Converts values to correct types (like float for numbers, string for text).

📌 It stores data as:  
`data = [ ([features], label), ... ]`

---

### 2. 🧭 `build_categories(data)`

**Purpose:**  
Identifies all **unique values** for the categorical features (like "Sex").

```python
for idx, ftype in enumerate(FEATURE_TYPES):
    if ftype == 'cat':
        cats[idx] = set(sample[0][idx] for sample in data)
```

📌 This helps when comparing categories like "male" or "female".

---

### 3. 📊 `count_labels(labels)` and `gini(labels)`

**`count_labels()`**: Counts how many 'Yes' and 'No' labels are present.  
**`gini()`**: Measures impurity of the list. Lower Gini = better split.

Example:

```python
labels = ['Yes', 'No', 'No', 'Yes']
# Output: {'Yes': 2, 'No': 2}
# Gini: 1 - (0.5² + 0.5²) = 0.5
```

---

### 4. 🔍 `best_split(data)`

**Goal:**  
Find the **best feature and threshold** to split the data for best classification.

How?

- Try each feature (Age, Fare, etc.)
- Try different split points
- Calculate Gini impurity
- Choose the split with **lowest impurity**

For example:
```python
If "Sex = male" gives better separation → choose it.
If "Fare <= 20" gives better split → choose it.
```

Returns:
```python
(feature_index, threshold_value, feature_type)
```

---

### 5. 🌲 `build_tree(data, depth=0, max_depth=6)`

**This is the core recursion function** that builds the full tree.

Steps:

1. If all data is the same label → make a **leaf node** (stop).
2. If max depth reached → also make a leaf.
3. Otherwise:
    - Find best split.
    - Split data into left and right groups.
    - Call `build_tree()` on each half recursively.

```python
if node is leaf:
    return {'leaf': True, 'prediction': label, 'counts': ...}
else:
    return {
        'leaf': False,
        'feature': feature_id,
        'threshold': value,
        'left': left_tree,
        'right': right_tree
    }
```

So it keeps splitting the dataset till it reaches leaf nodes.

---

### 6. 🧾 `print_tree(node, categories, depth=0, condition=None)`

This function **prints the tree** in a readable format.

Example output:
```
Tree
|   Passenger Class = 3rd
|   |   Age <= 25.0: No {Yes=3, No=5}
|   |   Age > 25.0: Yes {Yes=4, No=1}
```

Each level is indented using `|   ` to represent depth.

---

### 7. 🔮 `predict_sample(x, node)`

This walks through the tree to **predict for a given input**.

- If it hits a leaf node → returns the prediction.
- Otherwise → checks the condition (like `Age <= 20`) and goes left/right accordingly.

Example:
```python
if x[Age] <= 20 → go left → check next node → finally reach prediction
```

---

### 8. ▶️ `__main__` block (runs when you execute the file)

```python
data       = load_csv(FILENAME)
categories = build_categories(data)
tree       = build_tree(data)
print_tree(tree, categories)
```

Prints the decision tree. Then:
```python
sample = data[0][0]
print(predict_sample(sample, tree))
```

Predicts **whether the first passenger survived or not**.

---

## 💡 How Recursion Works in This Tree:

Each time `build_tree()` is called:
- It chooses the best split.
- Divides the data into two groups.
- Calls itself again on each group.
- This continues until:
  - All values in the group are the same label (pure), or
  - Max depth is reached.

## 🧑‍🏫 Python Terms You Should Know

| Term         | Meaning |
|--------------|---------|
| `def`        | defines a function |
| `float()`    | converts a value to decimal |
| `if ... else`| condition check |
| `for ... in` | loop |
| `return`     | gives output from function |
| `[]`         | list (like array) |
| `set()`      | unique values |
| `'key': value` | dictionary (object/map) |
