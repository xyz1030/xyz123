Absolutely! Here's a **clear explanation** of your code and how you're implementing **AdaBoost manually without using any libraries** â€” explained in an **exam-friendly** way with examples and reasoning.

## âœ… What is AdaBoost?

**AdaBoost** (Adaptive Boosting) is an **ensemble learning technique** that combines **multiple weak learners** (usually decision stumps) to form a **strong classifier**.

### ðŸ”¸ How it works:
1. Start with equal weights for all training samples.
2. Train a weak classifier (e.g., decision tree stump).
3. Evaluate its performance:
   - If the classifier does well â†’ give it **more weight**.
   - If it does poorly â†’ give **more focus (weight)** to the misclassified examples in the next round.
4. Repeat for `n` iterations.
5. Final prediction = **weighted vote of all weak classifiers.**

## âœ… Code Breakdown â€“ Step-by-step

---

### **1. Load CSV manually (`load_csv`)**

This reads the dataset and splits the values:
```python
data.append([float(v) for v in values[:-1]])
labels.append(int(values[-1]))
```
- All values except the last column â†’ features.
- Last column â†’ class label (should be binary: 0/1 or -1/1).

---

### **2. Train-test split manually (`train_test_split`)**

This function shuffles the data and splits into training and testing without NumPy:
```python
random.shuffle(indices)
X_train = ...
X_test = ...
```

---

### **3. Weak Classifier: Decision Stump (`DecisionTree`)**

A **stump** is a decision tree with depth = 1:
- It checks **only one feature** and makes a **binary decision** based on a threshold.

```python
if row[self.feature_index] <= self.threshold:
    return left_class
else:
    return right_class
```

#### ðŸŒŸ How it picks the best threshold:
- For every feature and every value in it â†’ try as threshold.
- Calculate **Gini impurity** for split.
- Choose the split with **lowest impurity**.

### **4. Train AdaBoost from scratch (`adaboost`)**

This is where the **boosting happens**.

#### Step-by-step:
```python
sample_weights = [1/n] * n  # Equal weights initially
```

âœ… For every iteration:
1. **Train a decision stump** on the weighted data.
2. **Predict labels on training data.**
3. Calculate weighted error:
```python
err = sum(sample_weights[i] for i in range(n) if y_pred[i] != y_train[i])
```
4. Compute alpha (classifier weight):
```python
alpha = 0.5 * log((1 - err) / err)
```
5. **Update sample weights**:
```python
weight = old_weight * exp(-alpha * y_true * y_pred)
```
6. Normalize weights so total = 1.

âœ” Store the classifier and alpha for final prediction.

---

### **5. Predict function (`predict`)**

Takes each classifier and its alpha value:
```python
predictions[i] += alpha * y_pred[i]
```
If total score > 0 â†’ class = 1  
Else â†’ class = -1

Final prediction = **weighted majority vote**.

---

### **6. Accuracy + Confusion Matrix**

Manually calculating:
- Accuracy = total correct / total
- Confusion matrix:
```text
         Predicted
         1    -1
Actual  ----------
  1   | TP   FN
 -1   | FP   TN
```

```python
[[tp, fp], [fn, tn]]
```

---

## âœ… Output Example

Say your weak classifiers correctly classify 85% of data after boosting. You might get:
```text
Accuracy: 0.85
Confusion Matrix: [[34, 3], [4, 29]]
```
This means:
- 34 true positives
- 3 false positives
- 4 false negatives
- 29 true negatives
