Hereâ€™s a neat **exam-friendly explanation** (for 10 marks) of your **manual implementation of SVM using gradient descent in Python**:

---

### Q. Explain the implementation of a Support Vector Machine (SVM) using gradient descent with code.  
**(10 marks)**

---

### âœ… **1. Dataset Loading (2 marks)**  
The dataset is read from a CSV file using the `load_csv()` function. Each row is split into features and a class label. Labels are converted to +1 and -1 for binary classification.

```python
def load_csv(filename):
    ...
    for row in reader:
        features = list(map(float, row[:-1]))
        label = int(row[-1])
        data.append((features, label))
```

---

### âœ… **2. Preprocessing and Splitting (1 mark)**  
The dataset is split into **70% training** and **30% testing** using random shuffling.

```python
def train_test_split(data, train_ratio=0.7):
    ...
```

---

### âœ… **3. Vector Operations (1 mark)**  
Helper functions are defined for operations like **dot product**, **scalar multiplication**, **vector subtraction**, and **vector addition**.

```python
def dot(v1, v2): return sum(x * y for x, y in zip(v1, v2))
...
```

---

### âœ… **4. Hinge Loss Function (1 mark)**  
The hinge loss is calculated as:

\[
\text{Loss} = \frac{1}{2} \sum w^2 + \lambda \sum \max(0, 1 - y(wx + b))
\]

```python
def hinge_loss(data, weights, bias, lambda_param):
    ...
```

---

### âœ… **5. SVM Training with Gradient Descent (3 marks)**  
The weights and bias are updated using gradient descent. Two cases are handled:
- **If margin â‰¥ 1**: Only regularization is applied.
- **If margin < 1**: Hinge loss gradient is also applied.

```python
for features, label in train_data:
    margin = label * (dot(features, weights) + bias)
    if margin >= 1:
        gradient = scalar_multiply(weights, lambda_param)
    else:
        gradient = vector_subtract(scalar_multiply(weights, lambda_param), scalar_multiply(features, label))
        bias -= learning_rate * (-label)
```

---

### âœ… **6. Prediction and Accuracy (1 mark)**  
Prediction is based on the sign of the dot product plus bias. Accuracy is computed by comparing predictions with true labels.

```python
def predict(features, weights, bias):
    return 1 if (dot(features, weights) + bias) >= 0 else -1
```

---

### âœ… **7. Output Results (1 mark)**  
The code prints:
- Loss every 100 epochs
- Final accuracy on test data
- Each predicted vs actual label

---

### âœ… **Conclusion**  
This is a **fully manual implementation of a linear SVM classifier** using gradient descent, without using libraries like scikit-learn. It shows a clear understanding of:
- Hinge loss,
- Gradient descent,
- Regularization,
- Model evaluation.

Sure! Here's a clean and **exam-friendly explanation** of what SVM is, and how **you are implementing it manually** in your code.

---

## âœ… What is SVM?  
**Support Vector Machine (SVM)** is a **supervised machine learning algorithm** used for **binary classification**.  
The main idea is to **find the best hyperplane** that separates the data into two classes with the **maximum margin**.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Key Concepts:
- **Hyperplane**: A decision boundary that separates the data.
- **Margin**: Distance between the hyperplane and the closest data points from each class.
- **Support Vectors**: The data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. These points determine the margin.
- **Objective**:  
    Maximize margin  
    â‡”  
    Minimize:  
    \[
    \frac{1}{2} ||w||^2 + \lambda \sum \text{Hinge Loss}
    \]

## âœ… How I am implementing SVM manually

You are **not using any libraries like scikit-learn**. You manually coded:
- Hinge loss
- Gradient descent
- Prediction logic

---

### ðŸ”¸ Step-by-step Explanation:

#### **1. Load and preprocess data**
You load the dataset from a CSV file and convert labels to +1 or -1 for binary classification:
```python
y = 1 if label == 1 else -1
```

#### **2. Initialize parameters**
You set:
- weights = [0, 0, ..., 0]
- bias = 0  
- learning rate = 0.01  
- lambda (regularization) = 0.01

```python
weights = [0.0] * n_features
bias = 0.0
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ 3. Train using Gradient Descent:
You update weights and bias using **hinge loss gradient**:
- If correctly classified (`margin â‰¥ 1`): only apply regularization.
- If misclassified (`margin < 1`): apply hinge loss gradient.

```python
if margin >= 1:
    gradient = scalar_multiply(weights, lambda_param)
else:
    gradient = vector_subtract(scalar_multiply(weights, lambda_param), scalar_multiply(features, label))
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ 4. Loss Calculation
You calculate **hinge loss** every 100 epochs:
```python
loss = hinge_loss(train_data, weights, bias, lambda_param)
```

---

### ðŸ”¸ 5. Predictions and Accuracy
You make predictions with:
```python
pred = 1 if dot(features, weights) + bias â‰¥ 0 else -1
```
Then compare with true labels to calculate accuracy.

## âœ… Summary:
| Part | What you did |
|------|--------------|
| Model | Linear SVM |
| Training | Manual gradient descent |
| Loss | Hinge loss with regularization |
| Prediction | Dot product of weights and features |
| Evaluation | Accuracy on test data |
