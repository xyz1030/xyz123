Absolutely, here’s a detailed explanation of each part of your **KMeans clustering implementation in Python**, written manually from scratch (no external libraries used):

---

### 📌 1. **Loading the CSV File**
```python
def load_data(filename):
    ...
```
- Reads the file line by line.
- Skips the first row (header).
- Converts string values to `float` for each row and stores them in a list of `[feature1, feature2]`.

🔍 **Why?** KMeans requires numerical input. This function gets your raw data ready for processing.

---

### 📌 2. **Min-Max Scaling**
```python
def scale_data(data):
    ...
```
- It rescales feature1 and feature2 into the `[0, 1]` range.
- This is done using:
  \[
  x' = \frac{x - \text{min}}{\text{max} - \text{min}}
  \]
- Ensures all features contribute equally when calculating distances.

🔍 **Why?** Prevents features with larger values from dominating the clustering.

---

### 📌 3. **Distance Function**
```python
def distance(p1, p2):
    ...
```
- Calculates the **Euclidean distance** between 2 points:
  \[
  \text{dist} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}
  \]

🔍 **Why?** Distance metric is at the heart of clustering—used to group nearby points.

---

### 📌 4. **Assigning Points to Nearest Centroid**
```python
def assign_clusters(data, centroids):
    ...
```
- For every point:
  - Computes its distance to each centroid.
  - Assigns it to the closest one (minimum distance).

🔍 **Why?** Forms the basis of clusters by proximity.

---

### 📌 5. **Recomputing Centroids**
```python
def compute_centroids(data, clusters, k):
    ...
```
- For each cluster:
  - Averages the `x` and `y` of points belonging to that cluster.
- Returns updated centroids.

🔍 **Why?** Each iteration moves centroids closer to the true "center" of the data assigned to them.

---

### 📌 6. **Convergence Check**
```python
def has_converged(old, new):
    ...
```
- Compares old and new centroids.
- If they don’t change significantly (within `1e-4`), training stops.

🔍 **Why?** Saves computation—stops once the solution is stable.

---

### 📌 7. **Main KMeans Logic**
```python
def kmeans(data, k, max_iter=100):
    ...
```
- Starts with `k` random data points as initial centroids.
- Then it:
  1. Assigns all points to the closest centroid.
  2. Updates centroids.
  3. Repeats until convergence or max iterations.

🔍 **Why?** Implements the basic KMeans loop.

---

### 📌 8. **Results**
```python
def print_result(data, clusters, centroids):
    ...
```
- Prints final cluster centers (rounded).
- Prints every point with its cluster number.

---

### 📌 9. **Execution Block**
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
```
- Loads and scales data.
- Runs `kmeans` for `k=3`.
- Prints the output.

---

### ✅ Example Output (for understanding):
Suppose we had this:
```
Final Centroids:
Cluster 0: (0.12, 0.82)
Cluster 1: (0.65, 0.48)
Cluster 2: (0.90, 0.13)

Data points with cluster labels:
Point 1: (0.1, 0.8) → Cluster 0
Point 2: (0.7, 0.5) → Cluster 1
Point 3: (0.9, 0.1) → Cluster 2
...
```

### 🔁 Summary of Workflow:
```
CSV → Load → Scale → Random Centroids
     ↓             ↘
     Assign Points → Update Centroids → Check Convergence → Repeat
                              ↓
                          Final Clusters
```
