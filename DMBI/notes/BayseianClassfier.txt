You're implementing a **Naive Bayes Classifier** manually ‚Äî and it‚Äôs done very well without using any external libraries. Let's go through your code **step by step**, explaining both **concepts** and **code behavior** clearly.

---

## üî∂ What is Naive Bayes?

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on **Bayes‚Äô Theorem**, assuming independence between features.

**Bayes' Theorem:**
\[
P(C|X) = \frac{P(X|C) \cdot P(C)}{P(X)}
\]

In classification, you calculate the probability of each class (C) given the input features (X), and choose the class with the **highest posterior probability**.

## üîç What Does Your Code Do?

You're classifying rows in a dataset (e.g., weather data) based on the **Naive Bayes algorithm**. You:

1. Load the dataset.
2. Calculate prior probabilities \( P(C) \).
3. Calculate likelihoods \( P(feature=value | class) \).
4. Predict the class of a new instance using the Naive Bayes formula.

## üìò Explanation of Each Function:

### ‚úÖ 1. `load_csv(filename)`

```python
def load_csv(filename):
    data = []
    with open(filename, 'r') as f:
        reader = csv.reader(f)
        headers = next(reader)  # first row is header
        for row in reader:
            data.append(dict(zip(headers, row)))
    return headers, data
```

- **What it does**: Reads your CSV file.
- **Returns**:
  - `headers`: List of column names.
  - `data`: A list of dictionaries, each representing a row like:
    ```python
    {'Outlook': 'Sunny', 'Temperature': 'Hot', 'Humidity': 'High', 'Windy': 'False', 'Play': 'No'}
    ```

---

### ‚úÖ 2. `calculate_prior(data, target)`

```python
def calculate_prior(data, target):
    counts = {}
    total = len(data)
    for row in data:
        label = row[target]
        counts[label] = counts.get(label, 0) + 1
    prior = {}
    for label in counts:
        prior[label] = counts[label] / total
    return prior
```

- **What it does**: Calculates the **prior probabilities** \( P(C) \) for each class.
- **Example**:
  If 9 out of 14 rows are "Yes", then:
  \[
  P(\text{Yes}) = \frac{9}{14},\quad P(\text{No}) = \frac{5}{14}
  \]

---

### ‚úÖ 3. `calculate_likelihood(data, features, target)`

```python
def calculate_likelihood(data, features, target):
    likelihood = {}
    target_values = set(row[target] for row in data)

    for feature in features:
        likelihood[feature] = {}
        feature_values = set(row[feature] for row in data)

        for value in feature_values:
            likelihood[feature][value] = {}

            for t_val in target_values:
                num = 0
                denom = 0
                for row in data:
                    if row[target] == t_val:
                        denom += 1
                        if row[feature] == value:
                            num += 1
                likelihood[feature][value][t_val] = num / denom if denom != 0 else 0
    return likelihood
```

- **What it does**: Calculates \( P(\text{feature=value} \mid \text{class}) \).
- For each feature and each possible value, it checks how often it appears under each class.
- This is the **conditional probability** part of Bayes‚Äô theorem.

---

### ‚úÖ 4. `predict(instance, prior, likelihood, target_values)`

```python
def predict(instance, prior, likelihood, target_values):
    probs = {}
    for t_val in target_values:
        prob = prior.get(t_val, 0)
        for feature, val in instance.items():
            prob *= likelihood[feature].get(val, {}).get(t_val, 0)
        probs[t_val] = prob
    return max(probs, key=probs.get)
```

- **What it does**: Calculates \( P(C|X) \) for each class.
- Starts with prior \( P(C) \), multiplies it by each likelihood \( P(feature=value | C) \).
- Returns the class with **maximum probability**.

---

## üì¶ Example Usage

Given:
```python
test_instance = {'Outlook': 'Sunny', 'Temperature': 'Cool', 'Humidity': 'High', 'Windy': 'True'}
```

It will compute:

\[
P(\text{Yes} | \text{Sunny, Cool, High, True}) \propto P(\text{Yes}) \times P(\text{Sunny}|\text{Yes}) \times ...
\]

And similarly for "No".

Whichever is higher, that‚Äôs your predicted class.

## ‚úÖ Full Flow Recap:

1. Load data from CSV.
2. Extract feature names and labels.
3. Compute prior probabilities.
4. Compute conditional (likelihood) probabilities.
5. Predict the class of a new input using Bayes‚Äô rule.

## üß™ Sample CSV (basyen.csv)

Here‚Äôs a minimal sample of your `basyen.csv`:

```csv
Outlook,Temperature,Humidity,Windy,Play
Sunny,Hot,High,False,No
Sunny,Hot,High,True,No
Overcast,Hot,High,False,Yes
Rain,Mild,High,False,Yes
Rain,Cool,Normal,False,Yes
Rain,Cool,Normal,True,No
Overcast,Cool,Normal,True,Yes
Sunny,Mild,High,False,No
Sunny,Cool,Normal,False,Yes
Rain,Mild,Normal,False,Yes
Sunny,Mild,Normal,True,Yes
Overcast,Mild,High,True,Yes
Overcast,Hot,Normal,False,Yes
Rain,Mild,High,True,No
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Output

When you run the script, output will be:
```
Prediction: No   # or Yes depending on the calculated probabilities
```

---

## ‚úÖ Suggestions

- You could implement **Laplace smoothing** (add-one smoothing) to handle zero probabilities.
- You might print intermediate values for better debugging (like prior, likelihoods, probabilities).
- For larger datasets, optimize with pre-processing or caching.
